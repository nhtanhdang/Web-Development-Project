    What is Streaming?

<p>Streaming overall is a system or method of showing video or listening audio content alternative of downloading the client video files.

              Consumers now can watch TV programs of all genres without the need of downloading files which take up storage space on their devices. Most of streaming platforms charge users on a recurring basis (user subscription model). The amount of money seems reasonable for users, taking into consideration offers of these platforms, such as high-definition (HD) or even 4K Ultra HD streaming, original content, no ads and many more. Streaming service also enhances interaction between users with live chat where people can communicate with each other simultaneously. 
              <br><br>
              Moreover, anyone can be a “streamer” with only one internet-connected device. They can stream from their own mobile phones or laptops via numerous streaming platforms such as Youtube, Facebook, TikTok, etc. This has contributed greatly to the diversity of entertaining content that we are now consuming on a daily basis.

              Audio or video files are broken into small data packets and every packet contains a small bunch of data<a class="footer-style" href="#section3" id="footnote4">[4]</a>. Either TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is used to exchange data over a network. When a client requests to receive the data packets, a video player will decompress the data and interpret video and audio. The more usable one for streaming is TCP as it’s more reliable protocol while UDP is more suitable for video conferencing. Video streaming is basically pre-recorded video files or a live broadcast feed. In terms of live broadcast, the video signal is converted into compressed digital signal from a server and can be sent to multiple users at the same time.

              Different features exist on streaming video (E.g., 720p, 1080i, 1080p, 4K). The more video quality, the higher speed needed for streaming and receiving higher smooth video quality.  Usually, most programs are broadcast at a standard of 720p and on the other hand, Netflix, Amazon prime video offer 1080p, 2160p or 4K.

          <dd>The first streaming service - video-on-demand service is iTV (interactive TV), launched by Hong Kong Telecom (HKT) in 1998. 
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <br>
        In 1993, when cable television first came to Hong Kong, there was a huge surge in its subscribers that soon made up 25 percent of the market. Following this trend, HKT was about to launch a video-on-demand service, which required more than $1,5 billion. At that time, Hong Kong had one of the highest per-capita incomes in the world and the region was small enough to be covered with fiber-optic cable. HKT also conducted a research showing around 80 percent of all the subscribers are fascinated by the iTV. All these factors had made Hong Kong the promised land for streaming service. 
            
        The launch, however, turned out to be not very successful due to many reasons. Only after PCCW acquired HKT had it really blown up.

          The most first popular video streaming site is Youtube<a class="footer-style" href="#section3" id="footnote3">[3]</a> which founded by Steven Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim on February 14th 2005. They gradually developed and used Flash-based player and later MPEG-4 AVC video and AAC video, now to HTML5 video.

    <div class="topic">
      There are many reasons why streaming media’s popularity is growing exponentially. However, the key factor contributing to this rapid growth is its convenience. This is considered as the opening of a new era since TV programs’ consumers all over the world then were exhausted of being tied to a TV schedule. Subscribers of streaming service can choose when they want to watch and what they want to see. The schedule now depends on them.
      <br><br>
      In the future, there is a great chance that people will be able to solve two major problems of streaming service, which are speed and quality. Consumers now are still having trouble with watching stream videos during peak hours because streaming takes up a lot of data and speed. Furthermore, there are a growing number of algorithms developed to personalise the users’ experience. The platform can now give recommendations on next movies based on users’ choices of previous movies. The accuracy of these recommendations will become considerably high soon. To summarise, this technology has a great potential of becoming a major field in the industry.

          <br>Provider of the video and stream admins will have the authority to make changes to the stream such as deleting videos, editing and adding videos to channels. They also decide who can view the videos. However, to most of streaming platforms, the providers or the owners of the video only have certain access to their own videos because the platform is managed by their own administrators.
